## Overview

**Blu** is an AI-powered VS Code extension designed to help developers work from goals instead of prompts.  
It understands your codebase, plans changes step by step, and executes them only after your approval.

Blu keeps you in control while accelerating complex development workflows.

---

## Features

- **Goal-driven workflows**  
  Describe what you want to achieve and let Blu plan the steps required to get there.

- **Codebase understanding**  
  Blu analyzes your project structure and files to generate relevant, context-aware suggestions.

- **Human-in-the-loop execution**  
  Review plans, diffs, and commands before anything is executed.

- **File creation and editing**  
  Create, refactor, and improve files with clear diff views and full transparency.

- **Terminal integration**  
  Run commands directly in your terminal and monitor output as Blu works.

- **Multi-model support**  
  Works with leading AI providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, and local models.

- **Extensible via MCP**  
  Extend Blu using the Model Context Protocol to connect APIs, databases, and custom tools.

## Getting Started

1. Install Blu from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
2. Open the Blu sidebar from the Activity Bar.
3. Start a new task and describe your goal.
4. Review Blu’s plan and approve changes as they are proposed.

Blu includes an in-editor walkthrough to help you get started quickly.

---

## Design Philosophy

Blu is built around **clarity, safety, and collaboration**.

Instead of making hidden changes, Blu shows you exactly what it plans to do and waits for your approval at every step.  
You stay in control while Blu handles the heavy lifting.
